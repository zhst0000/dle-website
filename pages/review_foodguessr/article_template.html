        <h1>Foodguessr Review</h1>
        <p><strong>Published:</strong> April 22, 2025</p>
        <p>As its name suggests, Foodguessr is all about where foods are from. Presented with a picture (or several), a list of ingredients, and a brief description of the dish, the player has 5 guesses to determine the dish's country of origin. With a straightfoward UI and tantalizing theme, this game is easily digestible for all players.</p>

        <p>Foodguessr is made by Playlight, who are responsible for other puzzle games such as Timeguessr and Autoguessr. </p>

        <p>Foodguessr is built on the "guessr" archetype. The daily puzzle is in a 3-round format. Each round starts with pictures of the dish, an ingredients list, and a description of the dish, with the name of the dish being additionally revealed after 3 incorrect guesses. Each guess must be a country from a predefined list. Incorrect guesses also provide a hot-cold and directional indicator towards the correct country. The player can score up to 5000 points per round, for a total of 15,000 points daily, with each incorrect guess losing 500 points. </p>

        <p>And if the daily isn't enough to satisfy you, Foodguessr also has a unlimited mode with 5-rounds.</p> 

        <p>The UI is clean and generally works well. But the images and overlay don't play well with all screen resolutions. The guess entry box and the dropdown menu of country can also be a bit finicky.</p>

        <p>Two main weaknesses stand out with this game. First, the clue progression frequently devolves into a geography puzzle. Since the information revealed by each incorrect guess is purely geographical - the game can feel a bit like throwing darts at an area of the map. The name being revealed after 3 guesses was a later addition to the game that'd I like to see the developers keep following. Revealing more ingredients would be the perfect recipe. </p>

        <p> The second issue lies in quality control. The assets are pulled from the broad internet, and descriptions seem to be machine generated; there are frequently errors, as well as semantic inconsistencies that undermine the integrity of the puzzle - for example, an ingredient listed by its name in a specific language, or the name of another dish listed in the description. Fortunately, the developers seem to be improving on this front, as I have noticed fewer errors over several months of play. </p>

        <p> This game has been a mainstay in our puzzler group since we found it, and it has only been improving. New UI features, meta reports, and significant content updates (in earlier days, it was not uncommon to see the same dishes repeatedly) indicate the Foodguessr devs have a continued commitment to improving their game. </p>

        <p><strong>Foodguessr is a broadly palatable entry in the "Guessr" genre that is fun to play and has few tricks to master. However, some jank in the UI and a theme-divorced clue progression mechanic hold the game back. 4/5 </strong></p>
